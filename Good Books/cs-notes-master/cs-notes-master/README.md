# Computer Science Notes

## :bangbang: Important Note! (December 2018)

Every year people reach out to thank me for these notes and ask if they can buy me a beer/coffee/whatever. I am endlessly grateful for these offers, but these notes are and always will be free, so if you feel compelled to offer something **please consider donating to one of these wonderful charities** instead:

- [Shelter](https://england.shelter.org.uk/donate) - This Christmas, 131,000 children across Britain will wake up homeless; your support can help Shelter to be there for every individual and family who needs them.
- [Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/Donation.aspx) - Malaria has killed more people than *literally anything else*; your support can provide long-lasting insecticide treated nets and save lives around the world.

Thank you.

## A Short Message From Me (Mark) (March 2017)

All of my notes are now complete and online, so my work here is done! Apart from corrections and revision material, there will be no more updates.

In 2016/17 alone I uploaded **418 pages of notes** totalling almost **38,000 words**. I have shared them for free and will continue to do so, but **I have a small favour to ask**: if you have found these notes helpful, please consider nominating me for the Exceptional Contribution Award, the Alan Turing Prize, or the Jelf Medal in this year's NMS awards season. Nominations can be made [here](https://internal.kcl.ac.uk/NMS/stu/prize/index2.aspx). Thank you!

To those who are using these notes to revise for upcoming exams - good luck! Feel free to reach out to me if anything in the notes is unclear or incorrect (my contact details are on my GitHub profile).

## Intro and Things to Note

These notes were written by me, [Mark Ormesher](http://www.markormesher.co.uk), during my revision for *Computer Science BSc* exams at *King's College London*. I am publishing them here to help my classmates and other students in the years below me. To the best of my knowledge they are correct, however please note the following:

- These notes are **not endorsed** by King's College London, the module lecturers, or any member of College staff.
- These notes are **not checked** by any qualified individual, and I offer no guarantee as to how accurate or complete these notes are. They are offered for free, as-is, and I accept no responsibility for how you choose to use them.
- These notes were relevant for my year, but **the content for your course may have changed**. Check your lecture slides, syllabi, tutorial guides, etc.
- These notes were produced for personal use (it's how I like to revise) and sharing them was an afterthough. That means that the handwriting is scruffy, some annotations may by irrelevant, and some topics might be skipped entirely.
- There are no notes for management modules, robotics, etc. Sorry!

## Sharing

:white_check_mark: Feel free to share these notes!

:white_check_mark: **Share a link** to this repo: [https://github.com/markormesher/CS-Notes](https://github.com/markormesher/CS-Notes).

:bangbang: **Do not** share individual files *(see above)*.

:bangbang: **Do not** pretend you wrote these yourself; you didn't. (Yes, I've seen people doing this.)
